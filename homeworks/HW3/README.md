# Homework 3 - SofaScore Frontend Academy

This homework is more creative than the previous one. There is only one task: create a new Web Application with Pokemon from the [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/).

There is no need for you to clone this to your repository, just open a new branch and start coding. Once you've finished open PR and request the review from me.

Try to utilize Slack and feel free to ask for help, explanation, advice, ...

## Requirements

Everyone should implement these features:

- Fetch Pokemon from API (https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
- Display Pokemon on the screen (use list, not table).
- User should be able to remove any Pokemon from the list

## Creative freedom

If you want to add some extra functionality to your Pokemon page, feel free to do so. If you don't like Pokemon, you can use some other API, just make sure that there is a route that returns the collection of items.

If you want to extend the functionality you could borrow some of my ideas:

- Implement pagination to extend the pokemon list
- Return deleted Pokemon to list
- Create an accordion list, which on expand reveals Pokemon info (render list, on list item click open info about that Pokemon)
