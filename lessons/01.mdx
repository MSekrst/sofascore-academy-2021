# Lesson 1

## Frontend, Browser, HTML, CSS

---

# Frontend

- "Visible" part of the web application
- Part that the end user sees and interacts with
- Runs in Web browser
- Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

<Notes>

- Term "frontend" can also have more abstract meaning -> it could represent any device or an application which displays UI (e.g. Android or iOS application)

</Notes>

# Client - Server Architecture

import serverClient from './images/serverClient.png'

<img className="big-image" src={serverClient} />

<Notes>

- Core architecture of a Web
- Server programming is also called "backend"
- Client programming (for Web Clients) is called frontend

</Notes>

---

# Browser

- Navigate web and _display_ web applications
- (e.g. üòÄ Chrome, üôÇ Firefox, üôÇ Edge, üòê Safari, üò• Explorer, üò≠ Opera Mini)

<Notes>

- [Market share (February 2021)](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share): Chrome - 63.9%, Safari - 19.1%, Firefox - 3.76%
- Display is generic term to encapsulate more complex browser phases

</Notes>

# Browser flow

import browserFlow from './images/browserFlow.png'

<img className="big-image" src={browserFlow} />

<Notes>

- Process starts when user enters URL to a web page / web application.
  - Browser need to locate IP address of a server (DNS lookup) to navigate user correctly
- Once user connects to the server, browser will automatically request server (via HTTP GET request) for `index.html` document.
- Browser then parses (reads) document and searches for additional documents needed for a page to be displayed correctly.
  - Those documents could be: CSS style sheets, JavaScript scripts, images, etc.
- All required documents will be requested by browser (again via HTTP GET requests).
- When browser has all resources needed it will start building the page. Browser used DOM (Document Object Model) to represet HTML structure.
  - Page building is 4 step process which is out of the scope of this lecture, but feel free to dig deeper if it sounds interesting.
    More information can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work#render).

# HTML

- **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage
- Created by Tim Berners-Lee to enable document sharing (text based -> links, headings, paragraphs)
- HTML tells browser how to display content
- HTML 5 is the latest specification (each version brings new tags and deprecates others) -> W3C

<Notes>

- HyperText -> text with references to other pages (links)
- Markup -> standardized set of notations (tags and attributes)
- Language -> not programming language (it's more of a representation or format)
- [W3C reference](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)

</Notes>

# HTML Structure

- **HTML Element: Tag + Attribute(s) + Content**
  - Tag: identifies element (`html`, `body`, `b`, `div`, `span`)
  - Attribute: specifies properties of an element (e.g. styling, source for an image, ...)
  - Content: displayed to user (text, other elements, ...)
- `<b>This is bold text</b>`
- `<div id="atribute_example">Text and/or other element(s)</div>`
- `<img src="path_to_image" alt="Text if image fails to load" />`

<Notes>

- HTML elements have 3 distinct parts
  1. Tag: identifier of an element - browser recognizes elements and know their specifics (e.g. `b` tag means bold).
     There are 3 types of tags (opening tag - `<div>`, closing tag `</div>`, self closing tag `<img />`)
  2. Attribute: elements can have attributes which define specific behaviour or a styling for the element (e.g. image source, element ID, ...).
     Attributes are not required if not needed.
  3. Content - Part of the element between opening and closing tag. Content can be any text, number, HTML element, etc.
     Some elements don't have content (mostly self closing tags, such as `img`, `hr`)

# HTML Code sample

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>SofaScore Frontend Academy</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Hello!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

- **HTML relations:**
  - Parent - Child
  - Siblings

<Notes>

- Each HTML document has `html`, `body`, `head` tags.
- Parent - Child - Child is content of a parent -> `html` is parent for `head` and `body`, `head` is parent for `title`, etc.
- Siblings - Siblings have same direct parent -> `head` and `body` are siblings

# CSS

- **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
- How HTML elements are displayed on device
- CSS3 specification
- `cssProperty: valueOfProperty;`
- `color: blue;`

<Notes>

- Cascading -> styles cascade (apply to lower levels) if not overridden
- Style Sheets -> suggests separate CSS file(s), but CSS could also be inline, or embedded in `style` tag
- `color` is property, `blue` is value, don't forget the semicolon (if omitted it would merge with next line and then both lines would be invalid and not applied)

</Notes>

---

# CSS Selectors

CSS defines styles and can be applied to single element, or to the group of elements

- Inline styling - for single element
  - `<p style="color:blue;">Text</p>`
- Style all elements with the same tag
  - `h2 { text-transform: uppercase; }`
- Style all elements with the same `class` attribute set to `className`
  - `.className { background-color: tomato; }`
- Style all elements with the same `id` attribute
  - `#uniqueId { text-align: center; }`
- Selectors can be mixed
  - `h2.specialHeading { padding: 8px; }`
  - `h2 .specialHeading { margin: 16px 8px; }`
- Universal selector (`*`), Grouping selector (`div, p { ... }`)
- Specificity: Inline style > Id Styling > Class styling > Tag styling

<Notes>

- Selecting tags could be useful for resetting default browser styling (i.e. `ul` elements)
- Classes are most common CSS selectors -> allow to style all elements with the same class. Same element can have multiple classes (e.g. `<div class="big blue rounded" />`)
- Id selectors are used sparingly. to style unique elements
- Id attributes should be unique for each element and should appear only once on each page.
  Plural form of the sentence is used because it would work on multiple elements with the same `id`, but this is an anti-pattern and should be avoided.
- Mixing selectors is useful when certain styles need to be applied only in specific context (e.g. styling inputs in forms differently)
- [CSS Specificity](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_specificity.asp)

</Notes>

# Adding CSS to HTML

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyleSheet.css">`

- embedded in `<style></style>` element

- directly on element

<Notes>

- When adding multiple style sheets, they are applied in order they are linked.
  Common mistake is thinking that styles are applied based on their order on element.
  It's actually their link order and order in file where they are defined. This all applies for the same level of selector (e.g. classes)\

- Common pattern is to separate styles from HTML markup, so separate CSS files are usually way to go.

# CSS Box Model

- Each element is a box defined with `x`, `y`, `width` and `height`,
- Content can be distributed in the box with `padding`
- Box can be spaced form other boxes with `margin`
- Box can be made visible with `border`
- `box-sizing` property changes how browser calculates size of the element
  - e.g. margin included or excluded from the `width`

<Notes>

- `x` and `y` mark the top left edge of the box
- `width` and `height` are applied to content part of the box
- `padding` is used to space and style elements inside the box (Content!)
- `margin` is used to define spacings between adjacent boxes (e.g. spacing between sibling elements)
- `border` draws line on the edge of the box
- `box-model` defines where the edge of the box is (e.g. before or after `margin` part of the box)
- (Box Model extra)[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp]

</Notes>

---

# CSS Box Model - Ilustration

import boxModel from './images/boxModel.png'

<img className="big-image" src={boxModel} />

<Notes>

- Default `box-sizing` is `content-box`, which includes only content.
- Sometimes `border-box` is more useful (includes content, padding and border). This is often used for layout purposes.

# CSS Display properties

- Display property is used to specify how should element behave in the parent element.
- Elements have default display properties defined in HTML specification
- Common display properties:
  - `block` - Element will take as much space as possible in the single row
    - no two block elements in the same row
    - e.g. `div`, `ul`, `main`, `p`
  - `inline` - Element will use minimal width needed
    - ignores width and height set
    - possible multiple elements in the same row
    - e.g. `span`, `b`
  - `inline-block` - inline element which doesn't ignore width and hight set
    - e.g. `img`
  - `none` - removes element from screen
  - `grid`, `table`, **`flex`**

<Notes>

- Display properties determine page layout and tells browser what to do with extra space in the row.

</Notes>

---

# Flexbox - display: flex;

- Displays element as block level container - element will remain the same, children will be changed
- Applies flexible width (or height) and positioning to children
- Aligns children on defined axis (row, column)
- Children positioning can be specified (align all with start, center or end of the parent container)
- If children take more space then available - define wrapping
- If children take less space then available - define layout

# CSS Position properties

- Type of positioning used for an element
- Used to define how should element be positioned based on its `top`, `bottom`, `left` and `right`, properties
- `z-index` - tells browser how to display overlapping elements (higher number first)
- Common position properties:
  - `static` - ignore position properties
    - default value
  - `relative` -> position element relative to element's normal position (`top`, `left`, ...)
  - `fixed` -> positions element relative to a screen (**not** content on the screen)
    - stays on the same place when page is scrolled
  - `absolute` -> positions element relative to nearest positioned ancestor (not `static`)
    - used to position element inside other element

<Notes>

- `z-index` - common for overlapping elements, if not preset, first element will be on top
- `fixed` -> relative to a screen as hardware, previously used for page navbars, not sticky is more common
- positioned ancestor -> any element with position property different then `static` (default)
- `absolute` -> commonly used with `relative` parent, `z-index` property changes if elements are before or after
- `sticky` is new position property, it's positioning depends on scroll position, alternates between absolute and fixed
- [More on positioning](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)

# Position and Transition Example

</Invert>

<Notes>

- CSS transitions allow smooth transition between properties, e.g. color change from red to blue will be gradual and not instant.

</Notes>

---

# CSS Media

- Allow different style rules for different device capabilities (resolution, orientation)
- Responsive design -> different styles for different resolutions
- `@media screen and (min-width: 400px) { ...will apply styles only on screens wider than 400px }`

<Notes>

- Today developers take mobile first approach -> first they write CSS for smaller screens,
  then they add media queries to modify styles for wider devices, as more users today has mobile phones and similar smaller devices.
