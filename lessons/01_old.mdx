# Lesson 1

## Frontend, Browser, HTML, CSS

---

# Frontend

- "Visible" part of the web application 
- Part that the end user sees and interacts with
- Runs in Web browser

---

# Server - Client Architecture

import serverClient from './images/serverClient.png'

<img className="big-image" src={serverClient} />

<Notes>

  - Server programming is also called backend
  - Client programming (for Web Clients) is called frontend

</Notes>

---

# Browser

- Navigate web and *display* web applications
- (e.g. üòÄ Chrome, üôÇ Firefox, üôÇ Edge, üòê Safari, üò• Explorer, üò≠ Opera Mini)

<Notes>

  - [Market share (February 2020)](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share): Chrome - 64.5%, Safari - 17.6%, Firefox - 4.6%
  - Display is generic term to encapsulate more complex browser phases (next slide)

</Notes>

# Browser - Flow

import browserFlow from './images/browserFlow.png'

<img className="big-image" src={browserFlow} />

<Notes>

Render engine steps:

- Parsing HTML and CSS -> generating DOM (DOM is object presentation of the HTML document and interface to external entities, such as JavaScript)
- Render tree -> contains rectangles with visual attributes in the right order to be displayed
- Layout render tree -> giving each rectangle exact position on screen
- Paint render tree -> Painting rectangles on screen
- Gradual process -> many smaller iterations (e.g. parse HTML chunk and layout render tree)

</Notes>

# HTML

- **H**yper**T**ext **M**arkup **L**anguage 
- Created by Tim Berners-Lee to enable document sharing (text based -> links, headings, paragraphs)
- **Structure of a Web page**
- Set of HTML elements, telling browser how to display content
- HTML 5 is latest specification (each version brings new tags and depricates others) -> W3C
- `<img src="path_to_image" alt="Text if image fails to load" />`
- `<b>This is bold text</b>`

<Notes>

- HyperText -> text with referecnes to other pages (links)
- Markup -> standardized set of notations (tags and attributes)
- Language -> not programming language (it's more of a representation or format)
- **tag** is `img`, **attribute** is `src` and `<img src="URL" />` is **element**
- [W3C reference](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp)
- [HTML validator](https://validator.w3.org/nu/#textarea)
- Each HTML document has `html`, `body`, `head` tags.

</Notes>

# HTML Code sample

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>SofaScore Frontend Academy</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Hello!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

# HTML Examples

We will go through some examples -> You can follow along

# HTML Recap

- Element - Tag - Attribute
- Attributes are specific for each tag (`id`, `class`, `style`, `title` are some of the global attributes)
- HTML mindset -> parent-child, siblings

<Notes>

- HTML mindset -> composing elements to create hierarchies. 
Most used wanted hierarchies are **parent-child** and **multiple-sibilings**. 
If some tag contains other then they are in parent-child relation. 
If two (or more) tags are next to each other in hierarchy (on same level) they are sibilings.
- [HTML global attributes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_standardattributes.asp)

# TASK 1.1.

## Write parent element(`main`) with 5 children elements (`span`)

</Invert>

---

<Invert>

# TASK 1.2.

## Substitute all `span` tags from TASK 1.1. with `div` tag

</Invert>

<Notes>

- notice how each element is in separate row now

</Notes>

---

# CSS

- **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets
- How HTML elements are displayed on device
- CSS3 specification
- `color: blue;`

<Notes>

- Cascading -> styles cascade (apply to lower levels) if not overridden
- Style Sheets -> suggests separate CSS file(s), but CSS could also be inline, or embedded in `style` tag
- `color` is property, `blue` is value, don't forget semicolon (if ommitted it would merge with next line and then both lines would be invalid and not applied)

</Notes>

---

# CSS Selectors

- Select all elements with the same tag
  - `h2 { text-transform: "uppercase"; }`
- select all elements with the same `class` attribute
   - `.className { background-color: "tomato"; }`
- Select all elements with the same `id` attribute
   - `#uniqueId { text-align: "center"; }`
- Selectors can be mixed
   - `h2.specialHeading { transform: rotate(180deg); }`
   - `h2 .specialHeading { transform: rotate(180deg); }`
- Universal selector (`*`), Grouping selector (`div, p { ... }`)

<Notes>

- Selecting tags could be useful for resetting default browser styling (i.e. `ul` elements)
- Classes are most common CSS selectors
- Id selectors are used sparingly. to style unique elements
- Id attributes should be unique for each element and should appear only once on each page. 
Plural form is used because it would work on multiple elements with the same `id`, but this is an anti-pattern and should be avoided.
- Mixing selctors is useful when certain styles need to be applyed only in specific context (e.g. styling inputs in forms differently)

</Notes>

# Adding CSS

- `<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="myStyleSheet.css">`
- Inline style > Id Styling > Class styling > Tag styling


<Notes>

- When adding multiple stylesheets, they are applied in order they are linked. 
Common mistake is thinking that styles are applyed based on their order on element. 
It's actually their link order and order in file where they are defined. This all applies for the same level of selector (e.g. classes)

# CSS Box Model

- Each element has `width` and `height`
- `margin`, `border`, `padding` (content)
- `box-sizing` property changes how browser calculates size of an element
  - e.g. margin included in width calculation

<Notes>

- `width` and `height` can be explicit, and automatic (based on content)
- (Box Model extra)[https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp]

# CSS Display properties

- most used `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, **`flex`**
- `display: none;` -> removes element from screen (0x0), stays in the DOM

<Notes>

- HTML display properties are actually CSS display properties. 
We separated them in HTML section to emphasize that different elements have different display value.
- [More on flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp)

</Notes>

---

# CSS Display property

- element default *display* property
- **Block** elements **are by default separated** in new lines
  - `div`, `h1`, `main`, `header`, `footer`, `p`, `ul`
- **Inline** elements **are by default NOT separated** in new lines, they are inline (in the same line)
  -  `span`, `b`, `a`, `em`, `img`
- **Table** elements render elements in table 
  -  previously used for layouts, now for tables only 
  - `table`, `tbody`, `th`, `td`

<Notes>

-In examples, you probably noticed that some elements are displayed in separate rows while others where separated with `br` element.

import task13 from './images/task-1-3.png'

<Invert>

# TASK 1.3.

## Extend TASK 1.2. using flexbox (`display: flex;`) and other properties

## to archive following structure

<img style={{height: '50%'}} src={task13} />

</Invert>

# CSS position

- Type of positioning used for an element
- `relative` -> relative to element position (`top`, `left`, ...)
- `fixed` -> realtive to a screen (**not** content on the screen)
- `absolute` -> relative to nearest positioned ancestor

<Notes>

- `position: static;` is default
- `fixed` -> relative to a screen as hardware, when you scroll screen doesn't move, content moves  
- positioned ancestor -> any element with position property different then `static` (default)
- `absolute` -> commonly used with `relative` parent, `z-index` property changes if elements are before or after
- `sticky` is new position property, it's positioning depends on scroll position (absolute or fixed)
- [More on positioning](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_positioning.asp)

</Notes>

---

# CSS transitions

- Allows smooth changing of property value over some time
- `transition: opacity 0.5s ease-in-out;`

<Notes>

- property, period, time curve -> transition syntax
- works on exact values only, start and end values must be known before transition.
Common bug is transitioning height from 0px to 100%, which doesn't work because browser doesn't know value for 100%.

</Notes>

--- 

# CSS Media

- CSS2 - different style rules for different media (screens, printers)
- CSS3 - different style rules for different device capatibilities (resolution, orientation)
- responsive design -> different CSS for different resolutions 
- `@media screen and (min-width: 400px) { ...will apply only on screens wider than 400px }`

<Notes>

- today developers take mobile first approach -> first they write CSS for smaller screens, 
then they add media queries to modify styles for wider devices
