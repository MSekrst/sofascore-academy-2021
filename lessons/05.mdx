# Lesson 5

## React.js - Hooks

# Functional Programming

- Computation is the evaluation of functions
- Immutable data
- Pure functions
- No side effects
- High order functions - take other functions as arguments
- Benefits:
  - Reduced complexity
  - Testability

<Notes>

- In FP everything should be expressed as a function.
- Immutable data -> Program data cannot be mutated in any way and there are no state changes. JavaScrpt has `Object.freeze` method and various libraries (e.g. `immutable.js`)
- **Pure Function** - function that always returns the same output for the same input.
  The function is pure if it depends only on function arguments, which are not mutated in any way (read-only).
  A pure function has no side effects and can be replaced with its output.
- Side Effects - changes in the system caused by some function (memory, network, I/O). Side effects are fetch requests, file system interactions, variable mutations, ...
- Reduced complexity - functions are easier to understand as they are more predictable
- Testability - pure functions are easily unit tested, just test input-output pairs (as they should always be the same)

</Notes>

# Pure Function - Example

```js
function circleCircumference(radius) {
  return radius * Math.PI
}

function circleCircumferencePure(radius, PI) {
  return radius * PI
}

circleCircumferencePure(5, Math.PI)
```

<Notes>

- Common mistake is the usage of language constants, they influence input, so they must be passed as an argument.

# React Hooks

- Extend capabilities of functional components
  - Add class component possibilities
- Can add state, side effects, memoization
- Rules:
  - The always same number of hooks
  - Only in the top level of functional component
  - Dependency array
- Prefixed with `use*`
- Component can have multiple hooks of the same type

<Notes>

- Allow functional components to replace class components, as class components could be deprecated in later versions of React.
- Hooks enforce some rules:
  - Component should always have the same number of hooks across (re)renders. Developers shouldn't add hooks conditionally or return before all hooks were called.
  - Hooks can only be specified in the top level of the functional component. Developers should add hooks only in the main component block. Hooks cannot be added in `if` or any other block (`for`, `switch`)
  - All hooks have a dependency array (except the `useState` hook which runs on every state change). Dependency array determines when should hook rerun.
    If a variable in the dependency array changes, the hook will rerun, if an empty dependency array is provided, the hook will never rerun.
- Multiple hooks of the same type can be used to enable developers to write SRP compatible functions and provide different dependency arrays for different hooks of the same type.

</Notes>

---

# `useState`

- Adds state to functional component
- Whole state must be always set
  - Provide whole next state not only changes
- No dependency array
  - Has explicit setter for state change
- **`const [state, setState] = React.useState(initialState)`**

<Notes>

- Encapsulate state in functional components
- Difference with `setState`: `setState` will merge new state with existing state, so developers can provide only changes.
  Hook setter won't merge provided the new state with existing state, new state will be anything developer provides to the setter.

</Notes>

# `useState` - Example

`const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)`

<UseState />

# `useEffect`

- Perform side effects in functional components
- Run some code on component update
- Can return function (Cleanup function)
  - Cleanup will be called when component is unmounted
  - Cleanup will be called before next rerun
- `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, `componentWillUnmount` in one
- `useEffect(() => { /* do something */ }, [/* dependency array */])`

<Notes>

- Side effects are effects observed from outside of a function (fetch request, event listeners, timers).
- `useEffect` is used to make side effects on each update (or when variables in dependency array change).
- Effect function can return the cleanup function, which is called on unmount or before the next rerun.
  The cleanup function is useful when developers have to remove event listeners, clear timers, etc.
  If cleanup wouldn't be called before rerun, listeners or timers would be duplicated, so before the next rerun, cleanup is called to remove previous listeners or timers.

# `useMemo`

- Used to memoize **value** of some operation
- Memoize expensive operations
- No side effects allowed
- No guarantees that function will not rerun with same input
- `const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeSomething(a, b), [a, b]);`

<Notes>

- Memoize return value for input argument, useful for expensive operations and calculations.
- Shouldn't perform side effects -> if side effects are needed, use `useEffect`
- Can't guarantee that memoized value won't be removed from memory and recalculated.

</Notes>

import { UseMemo } from './05-files/UseMemo'

# `useMemo` - Example

# `useCallback`

- Used to memoize function (Not function result)
- Memoize handlers passed as props to avoid reference changes to handlers
- `const callback = useCallback(() => { /* do something */ }, [ /* dependencies */ ])`
- `useCallback(fn, deps)` is equivalent to `useMemo(() => fn, deps)`

<Notes>

- Memoizes function without executing it, while `useMemo` executes function and memoizes value.
- Used to memoize handlers to avoid new handler reference on each render -> causes unnecessary re-renders where the handler is passed as a prop
- `useCallback` can be written as `useMemo` where a function returns memoized handler.

# React Refs

- React is declerative and abstracts DOM manipulations
- Refs are used to get reference on the underlying DOM element
  - Access DOM element properties (e.g. height, position, ...)
- Returns object with `current` key set to DOM object or `null`
- `useRef` hook - `const ref = useRef(null)`
- `createRef` method - `this.ref = createRef(null)`
- Refs are also used to store data which should not trigger re-renders

<Notes>

- React is declarative, it abstracts DOM elements and manipulations. Sometimes developers need access to underlying DOM elements.
- React Refs allows access to underlying DOM elements. Access to those elements allows developers to get element height, position, to add DOM attributes, ...
- Refs can be used in class components and functional components via the `useRef` hook.
- Ref will be returned in the object as `current` property. `current` property is a reference to DOM element or null if the element is not set.
- Refs can be used inside class components (`createRef`) or inside functional components (useRef`) hook.
- Refs are commonly used with generic base components (input, button).
- Refs are also used to store mutable data which should not trigger re-renders -> the same as the instance fields in classes

# React Context

- Share data between components in sub tree
  - Data is passed from `Provider` to multiple `Consumers`
- Consumers receive providers value
  - When Provider value changes, its consumers will rerender
- Avoids prop drilling
- Works with class and functional components (via hook)
- `const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultContextValue)`
- `const value = useContext(MyContext)`

<Notes>

- Prop drilling - In React data is passed top-down via props.
  Prop drilling is anti-pattern when some components receive props they don't need and pass them to their children components and patterns repeats deeper into the tree.
- React Context allows developers to share data between a parent and multiple children. The parent is called `Provider` as it provides value for children.
  The child is called `Consumer` as it consumes provided data.
- Rules:
  - Provider has to be rendered above children (it has to be the parent to children)
  - Consumer will receive data from the nearest Provider of the same type (if multiple rendered).
  - When Provider value changes, all its Consumers will rerender, to get new value.
- Context works with both class and functional components. To be more specific context can be consumed in class and functional components.
- Context is created with `createContext` function. The function receives an optional defaultValue which will be used as the initial context value.
  The context contains two components (that are used from the outside):
  - Provider (`MyContext.Provider`)
  - Consumer (`MyContext.Consumer`)
- Contexts are usually added to separate files and they export `Context` itself, `Provider`, and `Consumer` components.
